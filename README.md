*To Prof. Zwolinski
I've only included the Acode here because I have extra regexs to match code that isn't present in the Bcode. As I build ontop of 
new strings, it causes an error. 

Also, some tests I've tried don't work in the code but they work in the regex101 app. That is to say I've checked my code against the
string (the one in current use) and saw that the regex supported my conditional. The same code works for many other tests but a few slip by.
In this case you'll see the error message "There is an error in your code the compiler missed"
